All programming assignments are done in C++. Every lab has a test file that runs different tests on the program to ensure it works correctly and another file (named Lab#.cpp) that prints out an evaluation of the code, demonstrating if the code passed all the necessary tests. 
<br/>
First/Second Lab 
<ul>
<li>Consists of a program that can execute some operations on huge integers.</li>
<li>In the program, a class named "HugeInteger" exists. Within the class, there are constructors/deconstructors and several methods including "add", "subtract", "multiple", "compareTo", and more.</li>
</ul>

Third Lab
<ul>
<li>Consists of a program that can execute some operations on polynomial functions.</li>
<li>In the program, a class named "Poly" exists. Within the class, there are constructors/deconstructors and several methods including "addMono", "addPoly", "multipleMono", "multiplePoly", and more.
</ul>

Fourth Lab
<ul>
<li>Consists of a program that can execute some operations on polynomial functions.</li>
<li>In the program, a class named "Poly" exists. Within the class, there are constructors/deconstructors and several methods including "addMono", "addPoly", "multipleMono", "multiplePoly", and more.
</ul>
Fifth Lab
<ul>
<li>Consists of a program that can execute some operations on polynomial functions.</li>
<li>In the program, a class named "Poly" exists. Within the class, there are constructors/deconstructors and several methods including "addMono", "addPoly", "multipleMono", "multiplePoly", and more.
