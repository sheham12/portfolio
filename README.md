The "winter_2022_projects" folder includes 4 folders inside. Each folder is a lab assignment from a programming course named "Data Structures, Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics" at McMaster University.

The first/second lab 
<br/>
The third lab focuses on creating a program that can execute some operations on polynomial functions. In the program, a class named "Poly" exists. Within the class are several methods including "addMono", "addPoly", "multipleMono", "multiplePoly", and more. There is a file named "TestPoly.h" that runs different tests on the program to ensure it works correctly. The file "Lab3.cpp" prints out an evaluation of the code that shows if the code passed all the necessary tests.
