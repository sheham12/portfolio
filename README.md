The "winter_2022_projects" folder includes 4 folders inside. Each folder is a lab assignment from a programming course named "Data Structures, Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics" at McMaster University. All programming assignments are done in C++.
<br/>
<br/>
The first/second lab 
<br/>
*The third lab focuses on creating a program that can execute some operations on polynomial functions.*
*In the program, a class named "Poly" exists. Within the class, there are constructors/deconstructors and several methods including "addMono", "addPoly", "multipleMono", "multiplePoly", and more.*
*There is a file named "TestPoly.h" that runs different tests on the program to ensure it works correctly.*
*The file "Lab3.cpp" prints out an evaluation of the code that shows if the code passed all the necessary tests. *
